HackerOne's having another Bug Hunt this year. January just passed, but there's more coming. Nullcon in Goa... February 28th. Adobe's hosting a live hacking event focused on AI vulnerabilities. Prize is a Macbook Pro. They want us to find flaws in their AI systems. OWASP Top 10 for LLMs. Jailbreaks, prompt injections, safety filter bypasses. Sounds like fun.
