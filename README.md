I can't wait to attend the Nullcon Goa 2026 live hacking event! The chance to dive deep into Adobe's AI products and hunt for vulnerabilities aligned with the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs sounds absolutely thrilling. There's something special about in-person hacking events—the energy of fellow researchers around you, the instant collaboration, and the rush of discovering that critical bug before anyone else. Plus, competing for those top prizes (Macbook Pro, anyone?) adds that extra motivation. Whether it's finding an AI prompt injection or uncovering some unexpected logic flaw, these live events are where theory meets real-world impact. Ready to hack, learn, and maybe even take home some hardware!
